# Fine-tuning Qwen2-VL Model for Multilingual OCR

## Project Summary
Throughout this assignment, we encountered several challenges while fine-tuning the Qwen2-VL model. One major hurdle was managing dependencies—installing various libraries like `transformers`, `qwen-vl-utils`, and others took longer than expected due to compatibility issues and download times.

We were fully invested in fine-tuning the Qwen2-VL model to extract Hindi and English text from mixed-language images, but faced unforeseen technical challenges along the way. Every obstacle taught us something valuable, from handling complex multilingual datasets to understanding the nuances of fine-tuning a model like this.

Another challenge was configuring the model to handle both Hindi and English text in the OCR task. Fine-tuning a model of this complexity required extensive computational resources, which became an obstacle when working with large datasets and longer runtimes on Colab.

## Reflection
Today is the final day, and it breaks my heart to say that despite our tireless efforts, we couldn’t complete the assignment as planned. It’s been an intense journey of growth, but unfortunately, the time wasn’t on our side.

Despite these challenges, the process has been an incredible learning experience, enhancing my understanding of multilingual model training. I want to express my deepest gratitude for giving me the opportunity to work on this project. As a student from a Type III college, opportunities like this mean the world to me. I’ve poured my heart and soul into this work, and while I couldn’t meet the deadline, I still believe I have so much to offer.

I truly hope you'll consider me for an internship and give me the chance to prove what I’m capable of in the future. This experience, though challenging, has only fueled my passion to keep growing.

Thank you so much for your understanding and for believing in me.

Warm regards,
